# Get Help

TODO: Put a short description of the package here that helps potential users
know whether this package might be useful for them.

## Features

TODO: List what your package can do. Maybe include images, gifs, or videos.

Do you like flutter hooks? Well I do! It may well not be seen as best practice to use it within an app that already incorporates Getx but there are some benefits. Flutter hooks is especially good for creating and managing animation controllers as well as tab controllers. Any controller that requires vsync can be a pain to create within you controller. So don't: Use flutter hooks!

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
